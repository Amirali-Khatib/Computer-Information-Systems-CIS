# **Computer Information Systems (CIS)**
This course encompasses all the main concepts related to Python programming language. I used those learned materials to develop algorithms from scratch and implement data analysis on various datasets. I've also worked as a Teaching Assistant in the course and developed many tutorials (**Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** libraries).
Here is the list of the projects I've done as a student and a teaching assistant.
1. Library platform (adding new books to the libraries, editing their information) 
2. Carpooling system (allocating passengers to drivers under specific conditions)
3. Data extraction of Stats-bomb soccer analysis event data (using **object-oriented programming**)
4. Exploratory data analysis of 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP event data (using **Matplolib**, **Seaborn**, and **Mplsoccer**)
5. Taxi driver allocation using Numpy
6. Factory breakdown & Vu platform report (these codes have some inconsistency with the current version of Python and need a little bit of modification)
